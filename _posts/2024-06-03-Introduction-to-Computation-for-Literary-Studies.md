This course introduced different computational platforms, tactics, and practices applicable to literary studies. The objective of this course was to help participants gain familiarity with fundamental concepts and methods in computation so they could better appreciate the emerging potential of computer-assisted scholarship in the study of literature. 

We reviewed macro-analytical techniques using quantitative data, including world analysis, stylometry, digital mapping, network analysis, and computational image analysis. Throughout our days of exploration of these topics, we learned different practices and management of data for digital research in literary studies. The main objective of the course was for participants to leave with an improved understanding of how computational methods could be used to produce quantitative data for use in literary studies. 

During the four-day course, we experimented with numerous computational tools and discussed the theoretical considerations of the future of these practices for literary scholarship. Some interesting conversations throughout the course included in-depth discussions about language inclusivity in these computational analyses. We explored the challenges of using many of the tools/methods in non-English and non-European languages and discussed potential adaptations and the development of language-specific programs.

Other interesting conversations centered around the ethicality of using these tools in research. We examined different digital projects online and then discussed what these projects achieved, their impact on the research topic, and whether the research was ethically sourced and accessible to the subject matter.

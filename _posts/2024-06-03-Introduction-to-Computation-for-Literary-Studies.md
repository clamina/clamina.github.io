### *“What is humanities data?”*

Our instructor at the Digital Humanities Summer Institute began our course with this question. Even though the room was full of humanisits, we were stumped. After a moment, someone tentatively suggested, “Texts?”

 “Yeah, texts can be data. What else?” The answers began flying in from there. 

One woman shared her studies of graphic novels and said that comic panels serve as her data. Another pair of humanists described how they study different translations of texts and how diction and syntax are important pieces of their research. A librarian suggested that images can be data as well. Someone else said films, and another said recordings of speeches or historical events. All of these different pieces of media are considered to be “humanities data.” 

What distinctly separates “humanities data” from data within other fields is how humanists often place “subjective” judgment and argumentation over their data. Our instructor pointed out this fact, highlighting how these are hallmarks of humanities research, and continued to pose more questions. How does one then use machine computation within humanities research? How does someone translate “subjective” data to a machine that is trained to analyze and categorize things objectively? How can machines aid or orientate humanities research?

These are the questions that began our course: An Introduction to Computation for Literary Studies. 

Over a four-day period, we explored how “humanities data” can be interpreted with help from machine computation by looking at different computational platforms, tactics, and practices applicable to literary studies. The objective of this course was to help participants gain familiarity with fundamental concepts and methods in computation so they could better appreciate the emerging potential of computer-assisted scholarship in the study of literature.

We explored computational techniques that used quantitative data, such as world analysis, stylometry, and digital mapping. We were introduced to computational systems that helped visualize the quantitative data pulled from texts as well as programs that conduct computational image analysis. Throughout our days of exploration of these topics, we learned different practices and management of data for digital research in literary studies. 

Our course objectives for participants included:
1. To explore how computational practices can shape literary research questions.
2. To gain hands-on experience in open-digital environments to understand their democratic and dynamic nature.
3. To build a foundational knowledge base for future digital research endeavors.


Some interesting conversations throughout the course included in-depth discussions about language inclusivity in these computational analyses. We explored the challenges of using many of the tools/methods in non-English and non-European languages and discussed potential adaptations and the development of language-specific programs.

Other interesting conversations centered around the ethicality of using these tools in research. We examined different digital projects online and then discussed what these projects achieved, their impact on the research topic, and whether the research was ethically sourced and accessible to the subject matter.

While machine computation and the “subjectivity” of humanities research appear to be complete opposites within scholarship, this course demonstrates how computation can help guide, visualize, and even provide keen insights to literary research endeavors.

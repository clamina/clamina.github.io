This course was an introduction to different computational platforms, tactics, and practices applicable for literary studies. The objective of this course was to help particpants gain familarity with fundamental concepts and methods in computation so they can better appreciate the emerging potential of computer-assited scholarship in the study of literature. 

We reveiewed macro-analytical techniques through the use of quanitative data, including world analysis, stylometry, ditigal mapping, network analysis, and computational image analysis. 



Over the course of four days, we experimented with these computational tools and discussed theoretical considerations of the future of these practices for literary scholarship. Some interesting conversations throughout the course included in-depth discussions about language inclusivity in these computational anaylsises. Many of the tools/methods that we examined are more challenging to use in non-English or non-European languages. We discussed

Text visualizations transform complex textual data into visual representations that are easier to understand and interpret. They provide a visual summary of textual content, revealing patterns, trends, and relationships that may not be immediately apparent from raw text alone. An example of these visualizations is networks. 

Network visualizations refer to graphical representations of networks, which are structures composed of nodes (discrete entities in a network) and the edges (specific instances of relations between nodes). The nodes appear as dots that are connected by streching edges.

### Networks for Literary Studies

 Network theory is a theory that represents systems which contain discrete entities (nodes), with lines between the entities denoting their interactions (edges). In literary studies, these nodes and edges depict and analyze relationships, interactions, connections, and patterns within narratives.

An example of network visualizations created within the literary community is Martin Granjean’s [Network Visualization: Mapping Shakespeare’s Tragedies](https://www.martingrandjean.ch/network-visualization-shakespeare/). In his visualization, he took a corpus of eleven Shakespearean tragedies and represented each play in terms of the characters' interactions. Here is Granjean’s network of Romeo and Juliet (check out [his website](https://www.martingrandjean.ch/network-visualization-shakespeare/) for the other visualizations):

These visualizations sought to examine the structural complexity of the tragedies and compare them to each other. The networks also reveal the character groupings—like the Montague and Capulets in Romeo and Juliet. Our class discussed the aesthetic choices and possible conclusions that could be drawn from these visualizations and brainstormed other ways networks could be used for literary studies.
Character networks—like Granjean’s—can reveal central characters, character clusters, and their dynamics throughout narratives. Networks can also be used to map connections between authors based on collaborations, influences, correspondence, or shared themes. They can also illustrate thematic connections within or across texts to represent recurring themes or literary movements. 

### Creating Networks

Our instructor showed us the website [Palladio](https://hdlab.stanford.edu/palladio/) where we can create network visualizations ourselves. Palladio allows users to create interactive visualizations that facilitate the analysis of relationships, networks, and geographical distributions within datasets. In Palladio, you can upload tabular data to be created into different visualizations. The tabular data appears as those nodes and edges.

In class, our instructor provided us with a file of data consisting of Character Interaction Networks for the HBO Series “Game of Thrones.” We uploaded this file to Palladio, and the program created the following network visualization.

From this visualization, our class examined how the characters were grouped and how the main characters were populated in the middle of the network. Palladio allows you to interact with the visualization to zoom in on clusters for investigation and customize how you want the visualization to appear. Our time spent with Palladio allowed us to examine how these machines receive the data for networks and how we can make our own visualizations in the future. 

Network visualizations are an incredibly creative way to visualize and analyze texts. They offer literary scholars powerful tools for visualizing, analyzing, and interpreting the intricate networks of relationships and influences that shape literature. These visualizations are especially useful for scholars who wish to publish their data in an accessible way so that people within and outside the literary community can understand their findings. Network visualizations represent just one of the many visualization tools that we learned throughout this course that allow humanists to creatively present their data to the world.

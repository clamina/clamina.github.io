Hello! Here are some quick instructions on how to write in Markdown, create posts, embed images and links, and save your work. 

We are using [GitHub](https://github.com/), which is a developer platorm used to create, store, manage, and share all different types of code. This platform allows developers to easily collaborate with one another on projects, as well as share their work across the web for others to replicate and provide feedback. 

## Markdown Language 

Markdown is a lightweight markup langauge that describes how text should look on a page. It can describe headers, text style, links, lists, etc. 

We are writing in Markdown when we create posts on our webpages. This is why when we create files for our post, we end the title in *md*— which stands for markdown.

Follow [this How-To Geek Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.howtogeek.com/markdown-cheat-sheet/) when writing posts. 

We are **not** using markdown when writing in our _config.yml file, because this is written in a different programming language called yml. 


## Posts

Let's talk about how to create posts themselves. 

Repositories are where you can store you code, your files, and each file's history. You can have multiple collaborators in one repository. We will eventually be posting all our posts into a single repository for them to appear on one webpage. 

1. Go to your GitHub Dashboard and enter into the repository (found the the page's left hand side). 

2. Once you have entered your repository, click on the posts folder. 

3. Next, hit *Add file* > *Create new file*. You will want to title your file YEAR-MM-DY-title-of-your-post.md (the dashes appear as spaces in your title).

4. Once you have entered your new file, press the *period* button to enter into cospace developer. Here, you will be able to write your posts in markdown!

### To save your posts...

In the cospace developer, you want to sync your updates to GitHub. 

1. Simply select the *Source Control* widget on the left hand of the page (it's the third icon down with three circles and connecting lines). 

2. You will want to write a quick descriptiion of your update to the webpage in the text box, then hit *Commit & Push*. 

3. Go back to your repository on GitHub and select the *Actions* tab at the top of the page. This allows you to monitor how the update you sent over from the developer is syncing to GitHub. Once the action is completed, you can refresh your webpage and view your updated changes!

Good job—let's move on to embeding images into your posts!

## Embedding Images

Images are an important tool to use in digital communication—whether you are presenting your reader with a visualization of your research or want to share a cute image of your pet. For example, here is a cute image of my pet, Honey!

How did I upload such an awesome image? Glad you asked! There are two ways we are gonna look at to see how to upload images. 

### Upload from your computer

1. Select the *Explorer* tab on the left side of your cospace developer. This is the first icon that resembles two pages of paper. 

2. Open *assets* > *image*

3. Double click or control click on the *image* file and select *Upload...*

4. Upload your image to the file (you can rename your file here by doubel clicking/control clicking on the file and clicking *Rename*).

5. Now that your image is uploaded to the cospace developer, we can direct the program toward your image using markdown.

This directs the program to the *assests* > *image* > your selected image. 

### Use image from web

If you are using images from the web, make sure they are royaltly free. I like using [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).

1. Go to the web and select your desired image.

2. Double click or control click on the image and select *Copy Image Address*. 

3. Direct the program to your image on the web by writing, inserting your image adress in between the parentheses.

Once again, you will need to commit these changes to synce them to GitHub. Select *Source Control*, label your change, and hit *Commit & Push* to sync. 

Let's talk about embedding links onto our webpages. 

## Embedding Links

Embedding links into your post can allow you to easily direct your reader to other sources or to share other pieces of your work on other websites. 

1. Copy your desired *url* from the web. 

2. Write the following markdown, titling the hyperlink in between the brackets and pasting the *url* in the following parentheses.

![](/assets/image/url.png) 

And you are gonna want to sync your changes to GitHub. Select *Source Control* label your change, and hit *Commit & Push* to sync. 

Amazing work! Now you know how to create posts, insert images, and embed links.

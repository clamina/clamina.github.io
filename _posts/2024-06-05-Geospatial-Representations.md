Geospatial representations refer to visual or digital depictions of data and information tied to specific geographic locations on the Earth's surface. These representations integrate geographical data with other types of information to provide spatial context and insights. These representations generally appear in the form of maps. 3D maps, animated maps that display temporal changes, and interactive web maps are a few examples. 

During the third day of our Introduction to Computation for Literary Studies course, we explored different geospatial representations created by digital humanists and worked with programs to create our own visualizations. 

### Harnessing the Geospatial for Literary Studies

Geospatial representations can be used in literary studies to enhance the understanding, analysis, and interpretation of literary texts about their geographical contexts. Spatial technology can help trace patterns of geographic references unseen through close reading and help trace the movement of people, characters, and events in a narrative. They can also be valuable tools for teaching and pedagogy because they allow students to explore spatial dimensions of text visually. Additionally, these representations can facilitate the examination of spatial changes through history (like empire and nation-building) from a cartographic perspective. 

As a class, we looked at many examples of digital atlases created by humanists. When we examined these different geospatial representations, we discussed the context and goal of the digital map. What was the map trying to portray? Is the map trying to explore data or tell a story? How was the data for this map collected?

A digital mapping project that interested me was [A People’s Atlas of Nuclear Colorado](https://www.coloradonuclearatlas.org). This digital atlas “invites users to explore nuclear geographies, policy issues, artistic responses, and personal and scholarly reflections on the U.S. nuclear complex” (Kanouse and Krupar). The website’s digital map documents mines and mills, nuclear plants, processing sites, weapon production factories, and military bases within Colorado to track the movement of these radioactive materials. 

Geospatial representations are not just about visualizing data but also about analyzing spatial patterns and relationships. The Atlas is not only a digital map but consists of curated “pathways” of information and interpretation of how nuclear weapons affect people’s lives, local economics, regional identities, and the environment. After clicking on a location on the map, the site directs you to a description of the place and then suggests another location to mimic the path that the radioactive materials travel throughout in Colorado. This is called “scrollytelling”—a way to tell multimedia stories by scrolling through a website. Additionally, the site includes scholarly essays and artwork about the environmental, social, technical, and ethical ramifications of nuclear mining and weapon production. The image below displays the introductory pathway of the Atlas.

This map was extremely interesting to me because it presents the viewer with a spatial representation of these nuclear plants, weapon factories, and military bases alongside numerous literary resources and artistic representations of the effect of the nuclear industrial complex in Colorado. Exploring the site was a fascinating way to learn more about the issues of these processes, and a wonderful example of how geospatial technologies can be used to present literary information in creative and interactive ways. 

### Mapping Thucydides 

After exploring different mapping projects, our class set out to create our own geospatial representation of Thucydides’s History, which details the history of the Peloponnesian War. To make our map, we used a program called [Recogito] (https://recogito.pelagios.org/). In this program, we were able to upload a plain txt file of Thucydides’s History to annotate the text and connect coordinates to the place names mentioned.

From there, the program visualizes the coordinates onto a map, attaching the annotated text to that coordinate so you can press on the location and be directed to where it appears in Thucydides’s History. Experimenting with this program was an interesting exercise to explore a different way people can approach and annotate texts. 

Geospatial representations offer literary scholars new methodologies for studying spatial aspects of texts, uncovering hidden geographical dimensions, and fostering interdisciplinary approaches that bridge literature with geography, history, cultural studies, and digital humanities. This lesson was my favorite of the course because of the digital mapping projects we explored as a class. I was extremely intrigued by the multimedia scrollytelling projects and how they presented their data and interpretations. Below I will link some other digital mapping projects and scrollytelling sites that piqued my interest!
